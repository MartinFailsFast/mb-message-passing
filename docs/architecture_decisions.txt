# The APP microservices will be split into 4 independently deployable microservices:

1) API-Person Microservice — Handles all person-related data, backed by a database connected to the persons table.
The Uda Connect Frontend fetches person information via REST GET requests to this microservice.

2) API-Locations-Producer Microservice — Manages location data, backed by a database connected to the location table.
- Person data is requested via rest call to the API-Person Microservice and processed in the find_contacts method
- The Uda Connect Frontend retrieves location information through REST GET requests to this service.
- New locations are sent using a gRPC call. These gRPC posts are published to a Kafka topic.

3) locations-consumer Microservice — Consumes location messages from the Kafka topic and persist the messages in the database

4) The Uda Connect Frontend provides the customer UI
