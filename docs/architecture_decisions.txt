# The APP microservice will be split into two independently deployable microservices:
1) API-Person Microservice — Handles all person-related data, backed by a database connected to the persons table.
The Uda Connect Frontend fetches person information via REST GET requests to this microservice.
2) API-Location Microservice — Manages location data, backed by a database connected to the location table.
The Uda Connect Frontend retrieves location information through REST GET requests to this service.
Each Microservice has its own database table and could be migrated separatly to a new DB if necessary.

# New Location Data Flow:
- New locations are sent using a gRPC call
- These gRPC posts are published asynchron to a Kafka topic.
- A Kafka consumer processes messages from the topic and saves each new location entry into the location table in the database.
